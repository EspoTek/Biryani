# H-CompumedicsDirectDataStreamer
This is a slightly unintuitive piece of software that allows you to stream data from the Synamps2 Amplifier in the CfNE without having to use Curry or Profusion.
It actually won't even need Windows, once I include the OSX/Linux versions of Libusb (could also do Android if anyone was really keen...)

# Usage instructions
Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work yet...
But when it does, I'll put up some instructions.
